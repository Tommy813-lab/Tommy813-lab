🚀 Charles Bucher – CloudOps & Automation

I’m a hands-on CloudOps Engineer who builds and breaks things until they run better. Everything here was learned by doing — late nights, trial, error, and a few AWS bills I won’t forget. No shortcuts. No templates. Just Terraform, AWS, and automation built the hard way — the right way.

👨‍💻 About Me

CloudOps Engineer | AWS | Terraform | DevSecOps | Automation

Focused on secure, scalable, and observable infrastructure

Passionate about systems that self-heal, self-report, and stay compliant

Still learning every day — I don’t chase titles, I chase uptime and clean deployments

🧭 My Approach

I come from real work — not classrooms or theory. Every repo here marks another step in the journey from delivery driver to cloud engineer. I build things that stay up, scale right, and don’t surprise you at 3 AM.

If you’re looking for someone hungry to grow, quick to learn, and proud of what they build — that’s me.
