Who I Am
I'm 40, married with three kids, and I work part-time delivering packages while teaching myself cloud infrastructure at night. I'm building a tech career from scratch—no degree, no bootcamp, just AWS documentation and GitHub.
I'm not here to impress you with buzzwords. I'm here because I can learn fast, work hard, and build things that work.

Current Situation
Day job: Part-time delivery driver
Learning schedule: 2-3 hours/night after kids sleep (11pm-2am)
Goal: Land an entry-level cloud/DevOps role within 6 months
Why I'm different: I don't quit. I've been coding every night for months while working and raising three kids. If I can do this, I can handle production systems.

What I'm Actually Building
AWS VPC Lab - Learning Networking
Reality: Following AWS docs to understand VPC basics
What I've done: Created VPC with public/private subnets in console
What broke: Forgot NAT gateway route, private instances couldn't reach internet
Cost lesson: Left NAT gateway running longer than needed
View Project
CloudWatch Monitoring Practice
Reality: Learning how to set up basic alerts and dashboards
What I've done: EC2 CPU alarms, SNS email notifications
Still learning: How to parse CloudWatch logs, cost optimization
Next: Adding GuardDuty (reading docs now)
View Project
GuardDuty Security Lab
Reality: Practicing threat detection in a test environment
What I've done: Enabled GuardDuty, generated sample findings
What I'm figuring out: How to automate responses with Lambda
Honest assessment: More learning than automation right now
View Project
IT Support Scripts
Reality: Basic PowerShell and Bash practice
What I've done: File management scripts, system info gathering
Why it matters: Building automation skills from the ground up

Why I'm Doing This
I work as a delivery driver while my wife handles chat support. We have three kids in Tasmpa,FL. I'm building this career so my kids see what's possible when you refuse to give up—even when life gives you every reason to quit.
If you're hiring for entry-level cloud roles and you value determination over pedigree, let's talk.

"I'm not the most qualified candidate. But I'll outwork everyone else in the interview pool."
