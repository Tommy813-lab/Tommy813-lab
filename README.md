## Who I Am

I'm 40, married with three kids, and I work part-time delivering packages while teaching myself cloud infrastructure at night. I got my GED in prison in 2007, got out in 2008, and haven't looked back. Now I'm building a tech career from scratch—no degree, no bootcamp, just AWS documentation and GitHub.

I'm not here to impress you with buzzwords. I'm here because I can learn fast, work hard, and build things that work.

## Current Situation

- **Day job**: Part-time delivery driver ($20k/year)
- **Learning schedule**: 2-3 hours/night after kids sleep (11pm-2am)
- **Goal**: Land an entry-level cloud/DevOps role ($50-70k) within 6 months
- **Background**: Felon (2003-2008). Clean record since release.
- **Why I'm different**: I don't quit. I've been coding every night for months while working and raising three kids. If I can do this, I can handle production systems.

## My Commits Tell the Story

I commit small changes daily because I learned that big commits hide where things break. Check my contribution graph—it's steady because I show up every night, even when I'm tired.

## Why I'm Doing This

I make $20k/year delivering packages. My wife makes $33k in chat support. We have three kids and live paycheck to paycheck in Pinellas Park. I'm building this career so my kids see what's possible when you refuse to give up—even when life gives you every reason to quit.

If you're hiring for entry-level cloud roles and you value determination over pedigree, let's talk.
