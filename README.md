🚀 Charles Bucher – CloudOps & Automation Portfolio












I’m a hands-on CloudOps Engineer who builds and breaks things until they run better.
Everything here was learned by doing — late nights, trial, error, and a few AWS bills I won’t forget.
No shortcuts. No templates. Just Terraform, AWS, and automation built the hard way — the right way.

👨‍💻 About Me

CloudOps Engineer | AWS | Terraform | DevSecOps | Automation

Focused on secure, scalable, and observable infrastructure

Passionate about systems that self-heal, self-report, and stay compliant

Still learning every day — I don’t chase titles, I chase uptime and clean deployments

🧭 What Drives Me

I come from real work — not classrooms or theory.
Every repo here marks another step in the journey from delivery driver to cloud engineer.
I build things that stay up, scale right, and don’t surprise you at 3 AM.

If you’re looking for someone hungry to grow, quick to learn, and proud of what they build — that’s me.

🚀 WHY HIRE ME?
</div>
I bring what bootcamp grads can't:
✅ Real-world problem solving - I've debugged more infrastructure issues at 2 AM than most have seen in labs
✅ Self-starter mentality - Nobody taught me this. I learned by building and breaking things
✅ [REMOVED] mindset - Every project is built like it's going to prod tomorrow
✅ Documentation discipline - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
✅ Hunger to prove myself - I'm not here for participation trophies. I'm here to build.
My career transition proves I can:

Learn complex technical skills independently
Stay committed through adversity
Balance competing priorities (family + learning + work)
Ship real projects, not just talk about them
