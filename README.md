ðŸš€ Charles Bucher â€“ CloudOps & Automation Portfolio












Iâ€™m a hands-on CloudOps Engineer who builds and breaks things until they run better.
Everything here was learned by doing â€” late nights, trial, error, and a few AWS bills I wonâ€™t forget.
No shortcuts. No templates. Just Terraform, AWS, and automation built the hard way â€” the right way.

ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ’» About Me

CloudOps Engineer | AWS | Terraform | DevSecOps | Automation

Focused on secure, scalable, and observable infrastructure

Passionate about systems that self-heal, self-report, and stay compliant

Still learning every day â€” I donâ€™t chase titles, I chase uptime and clean deployments

ðŸ§­ What Drives Me

I come from real work â€” not classrooms or theory.
Every repo here marks another step in the journey from delivery driver to cloud engineer.
I build things that stay up, scale right, and donâ€™t surprise you at 3 AM.

If youâ€™re looking for someone hungry to grow, quick to learn, and proud of what they build â€” thatâ€™s me.

ðŸš€ WHY HIRE ME?
</div>
I bring what bootcamp grads can't:
âœ… Real-world problem solving - I've debugged more infrastructure issues at 2 AM than most have seen in labs
âœ… Self-starter mentality - Nobody taught me this. I learned by building and breaking things
âœ… [REMOVED] mindset - Every project is built like it's going to prod tomorrow
âœ… Documentation discipline - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
âœ… Hunger to prove myself - I'm not here for participation trophies. I'm here to build.
My career transition proves I can:

Learn complex technical skills independently
Stay committed through adversity
Balance competing priorities (family + learning + work)
Ship real projects, not just talk about them
